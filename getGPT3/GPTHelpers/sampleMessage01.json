I have no reservations about trusting the A/B data that shows more views when tricks like this are used. I spent a few years of my past life managing Bing’s search results page, optimizing for engagement <https://youtu.be/_dGAzDd18x4>  (this was a strategy that I started in 2010 and is still being built upon in Bing today), with days spent poring over mega-scale data. We developed techniques to not just track clicks, but to weight data based upon nature of engagement. \r\n \r\nWhat I’d like to see us do here is begin to understand the nature of engagement – positive or negative – that comes with the upticks. LinkedIn may not give us nuances like dwell-time or click-through status on each post (do they? Last I checked, not), but we should review each case for downstream impact.\r\n \r\nLet me share an example from last night: @Todd Warren <mailto:todd@envorso.com> , the author of the blog post himself, re-shared Envorso’s post. That’s the dream scenario of engagement! It’s a duplication of one’s post to an entirely new community.  Here’s a screenshot of Todd’s repost: <https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAEBsABlN322VENnvstsIvzfiw5rqpFOkk%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAEBsABlN322VENnvstsIvzfiw5rqpFOkk&keywords=todd%20warren&position=0&searchId=502db7a2-cc1a-466c-858c-667661c581a9&sid=aF(&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7026230357574262785%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)> \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI felt sad for Todd and for his LinkedIn network when I encountered this in my feed, because it has no link to the blog post!  Here is the guy posting about his blog update and readers have no way to click through to read what Todd is posting about.  This makes Todd look forgetful, and Envorso look kind of unprofessional, IMO.\r\n \r\nThis would fall into the negative engagement. We got some extra view-count, but no engagement. \r\n \r\nThere are many other techniques that can be employed to boost awareness, view counts, and positive engagement with us. Things like replacing stock photos with actual people’s photos, including brand new shiny vehicles in posts (our team has a huge set of photo from events), and asking our employee base to re-share high-value posts to their networks. I’d love to see us employ all of these techniques, which I’m sure is on your roadmap. I wouldn’t suggest doing things counter to A/B data in the future based upon arbitrary opinion, but I do feel pretty strongly that this example illustrates what we should not be doing given the negative impressions (more impressions, sure) it can cause during engagement.\r\n \r\nIn the meantime, @Todd <mailto:todd@envorso.com>  you might want to edit your post in include a link to what you’re talking about. \r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nJeff\r\n \r\nFrom: Amelia Forczak <amelia@pithywordsmithery.com <mailto:amelia@pithywordsmithery.com> >\r\nDate: Wednesday, February 1, 2023 at 4:50 AM\r\nTo: Jeff Henshaw <jeff.henshaw@envorso.com <mailto:jeff.henshaw@envorso.com> >\r\nCc: Candice Kriel <Candice@envorso.com <mailto:Candice@envorso.com> >, Todd Warren <todd@envorso.com <mailto:todd@envorso.com> >, Adrian Balfour <Adrian@envorso.com <mailto:Adrian@envorso.com> >, Scott Tobin <scott.tobin@envorso.com <mailto:scott.tobin@envorso.com> >\r\nSubject: Re: Can we re-do this post?\r\n \r\nHi Jeff,\r\nThanks for your feedback. Have you seen Envorso's viewership stats on recent posts? Even though there are over 4K followers, posts are not getting seen. (Some posts get around 200 views, which is super low.) We are trying to do whatever we can to raise the view rate or people won't even have a chance to see the post and click through. I've A/B tested this strategy and it works better to get more views. If you guys want to do it differently in the future, that's up to you. The strategy that we use when we're starting from nothing is different from what we would do if we had much more momentum. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n \r\nAmelia Forczak\r\nFounder\r\namelia@pithywordsmithery.com <mailto:amelia@pithywordsmithery.com> \r\nPithy Wordsmithery <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpithywordsmithery.com%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526409948809%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=D%2FsKETOeSAsv3qYxIbUzaTe6DPfRwlfiqj%2B3sngu3xQ%3D&reserved=0> \r\n312.550.4961\r\n \r\nCheck out our video - How to Start a Book - The First Sentence <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDu2jMmGpPZo&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526409948809%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=8kAzobHZYOVBmvNDzU2YNQAVwjoESKWuqbQ1BKM09PY%3D&reserved=0> \r\n \r\nInstagram <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fpithy_wordsmithery%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526409948809%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7bt02%2B1WgJc83vbCbJIhtyixe%2BPhKxjghldRkaDhgKg%3D&reserved=0>  | LinkedIn <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fameliaforczak%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526409948809%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=a1azaacUzfifv%2FzqHMxz7DDw7%2FdP6jJ7yilmPAJQPAg%3D&reserved=0>  | YouTube <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCl49jGer_ZjVPrN51N7T7RA&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526410105047%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nXMBeLBmPgrH148bbArGT4e5avumnEk0mAHQz08uxFA%3D&reserved=0>  | Facebook <https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpithywordsmithery&data=05%7C01%7Cjeff.henshaw%40envorso.com%7Cc5e54ac9600d4e93283a08db0452e8c4%7Cd9c3cfd0bde448eb9b3a9c30c0d51745%7C0%7C0%7C638108526410105047%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DQ5Ljbd%2Bsw7kxBfrspA9%2FkLtsPBCBZlpxc6bm3a5zQs%3D&reserved=0> \r\n \r\n \r\nOn Tue, Jan 31, 2023 at 11:45 PM Jeff Henshaw <jeff.henshaw@envorso.com <mailto:jeff.henshaw@envorso.com> > wrote:\r\n\tI’m very surprised to see that guidance.
